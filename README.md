Choose either Gradle or Maven and the language you want to use. This guide assumes that you chose Java.

Click Dependencies and select Spring Data MongoDB.

Click Generate.

Download the resulting ZIP file, which is an archive of a web application that is configured with your choices.

If your IDE has the Spring Initializr integration, you can complete this process from your IDE.
You can also fork the project from Github and open it in your IDE or other editor.
